I am a 14-year-old boy learning how to code.
I'm currently learning full-stack web development.
I have always been interested in computers since before I was even old enough to use computers.
I just know that is my purpose so I spent the last few months learning how to code.
I know quite a lot right now but I can always improve my skills and learn more.
